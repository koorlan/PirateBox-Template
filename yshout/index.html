				<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
				<p>Hello and congratulations on your installation of YShout. This page is here to inform you of a hopefully successful installation. If you'd like to see if YShout has installed properly, mosey on over to the <a href="example/">example YShout</a> &mdash; if it's there, then everything has worked!</p>
				<p>If the example does not appear, try chmodding everything inside the YShout directory to <em>777</em>. This step is not required on all servers, but there are some for which it is imperative in order for YShout to be able to function.</p>

				<h2>Integration</h2>
				<p>To include YShout within your webpage, follow these instructions. First, add the following code to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of a page you wish YShout to appear on. (make sure the path is correct):
<pre><code>&lt;script src="yshout/js/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="yshout/js/yshout.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="yshout/example/css/light.yshout.css" /&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
   new YShout({
      yPath: '<span class="ys-url"></span>'
   });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>YShout can take a few arguments in its constructor, as shown below:</p>
					
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	new YShout({
	   yPath: '<span class="ys-url"></span>',
	   log: 1
	});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
	
				<ul>
					<li><code>yPath</code>: When using YShout on your own page, set this to the complete URL to YShout &mdash in this case, <em class="ys-url"></em>. This is the only necessary argument, the rest are fully optional.</li>
					<li><code>log</code>: If you want the same shoutbox to appear on all pages you include YShout on, you don't even need to include <code>log</code> in the constructor. If you do want different conversations on different pages, however, set <code>log</code> to a different number on each page. By default, you can only have 5 different chat logs, but this can be changed from the <a href="cp/">control panel</a>.</li>
					<li><code>yLink</code>: Set this to the id of an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element. That link, when clicked, will open YShout in a translucent overlay &mdash; <a id="ylink" href="#">example</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Lastly, add the following code where you want YShout to be displayed:</p>
				<pre><code>&lt;div id="yshout"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

				<p>And that's it &mdash; you're all set, enjoy!</p>
				
				<h2>Customization</h2>
				<p>If you're not satisfied with the way YShout set up and would like to twiddle with some preferences, there is a <a href="cp/">control panel</a> set up for that express purpose &mdash; the default password is <em>fortytwo</em>. You can configure many options from the control panel, as well as manage bans.</p>
				<p>If you'd like to peruse through the previous messages, YShout 5 also includes a new and improved <a href="history/">history viewer</a>. In order to ban people and delete messages from the history, log into the control panel; once you're logged in, you will see little hover controls next to the messages, allowing you to manage the messages.</p>
				<p>As for custom stylesheets, YShout comes with the example style, as well as two simpler ones: light and dark. These two are located in the <em>example/css</em> folder, and you can either use them directly, or modify them to your liking. View the <a href="example/light.html">light</a>  or the <a href="example/dark.html">dark</a> style.</p>
